*** Test Cases ***
# This test case is never going to be executed. 
# It only exists because without a test case present in the file,

*** Keywords ***
Data Driver Main
    [Documentation]                 This is the datadriver's single point of entry which takes all data from the Excel sheet and calls the target keyword
    [arguments]                     REPLACE_DATA_DRIVER_ARGUMENTS_REPLACE

    ${ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT} =          Validate Robot Environment                  ENVIRONMENT=${ROBOT_ENVIRONMENT}
    ${EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE} =       Get The Expected Status Code From Excel	    EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE=${EXPECTED_STATUS_CODE}

    Run Keyword                     Data_Driver_${API_OPERATION}_${API_CALL}  REPLACE_DATA_DRIVER_ARGUMENTS_REPLACE

Check DataDriver Library Version
    [Documentation]  Checks the robotframework-datadriver library version and aborts if we don't use minimum version 1.5.x
    # Get the Datadriver library version. Will be in x.x.x format, e.g. 1.5.0
    ${ver}=			evaluate  (DataDriver.DataDriver.ROBOT_LIBRARY_VERSION)

    # Split up the string and get the major and minor versions, then convert the values to integer
	${words}=		Split String	    ${ver}	     .
	${major}=		Convert To Integer	${words[0]}
	${minor}=		Convert To Integer	${words[1]}
	
    # Check the version and fail the test if necessary
	Run Keyword If	'${major}' == '1' and '${minor}' < '5'		Fatal Error	msg=Incorrect DataDriver installed. We need at least version 1.5.0. Present Version is '${ver}'
